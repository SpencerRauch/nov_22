#FOUR PILLARS

#Encapsulation
#the idea of grouping all our code into an entity known as a class

#Abstraction


#Polymorphism -- literally means many forms
#we can over write methods of a parent class in the child class

#Inheritance 
#allows us to inherit from a parent class and gain all its methods and attributes
